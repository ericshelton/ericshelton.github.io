  <p>Eric Shelton is a designer and photographer based in New York City. He is originally from Philly where he went to The University of the Arts, studied Graphic Design, and graduated in 2014. Yes, cheesesteaks are his favorite food—1 Whiz wit’. </p>

<p>His work is research and strategy-driven, and thrives on collaboration. It has been developed with multidisciplinary teams of digital gurus, strategists, architects, designers, and writers. </p>

<p>Eric’s most recent work is focused on developing immersive brands and architecturally-scaled experiences. Transforming strategy to storytelling and purpose through visual and tactile mediums, he aims to create meaningful change in communities through simplicity and clarity. </p>

<p>He also wonders why these pages are always written in third person (like he’s done here).</p>
